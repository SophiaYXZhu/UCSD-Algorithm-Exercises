# Data Structures and Algorithms Practices
All attempts to solve problems in the Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization by UC San Diego on Coursera.
If you are interested in learning about algorithms, I strongly recommend Algorithm Design by Jon Kleinberg and Eva Tardos (https://archive.org/details/AlgorithmDesign1stEditionByJonKleinbergAndEvaTardos2005PDF/page/n105/mode/2up).
