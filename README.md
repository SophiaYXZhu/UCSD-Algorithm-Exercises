# Data Structures and Algorithms Practices
Solutions to problems in the Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization by UC San Diego on Coursera. <br />
If you are interested in learning about algorithms, I strongly recommend Algorithm Design by Jon Kleinberg and Eva Tardos (https://archive.org/details/AlgorithmDesign1stEditionByJonKleinbergAndEvaTardos2005PDF/page/n105/mode/2up). <br />
The exercise problems for Course 1 (Algorithmic Toolbox) is https://alexanderskulikov.github.io/files/toolbox_statements.pdf. <br />
The exercise problems for Course 2 (Data Structures) are listed below:
- Week 1: [week1_basic_data_structures.pdf](https://github.com/SophiaYXZhu/UCSD-Algorithm-Exercises/files/11505582/week1_basic_data_structures.pdf)
- Week 2: [week2_priority_queues_and_disjoint_sets.pdf](https://github.com/SophiaYXZhu/UCSD-Algorithm-Exercises/files/11505587/week2_priority_queues_and_disjoint_sets.pdf)
- Week 3: [week3_hash_tables.pdf](https://github.com/SophiaYXZhu/UCSD-Algorithm-Exercises/files/11505590/week3_hash_tables.pdf)
- Week 4: [week4_binary_search_trees.pdf](https://github.com/SophiaYXZhu/UCSD-Algorithm-Exercises/files/11505594/week4_binary_search_trees.pdf)
